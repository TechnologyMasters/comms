## What is Functions 2018?

FaaS _(Function as a Service)_ architecture is radically changing how software is built and how teams interface with each other and systems at scale. The old paradigms of Web Services and Monolithic APIs are being replaced with remote functions, event-driven architectures, and new standards like Microservices, Serverless and GraphQL. We're organizing a space for Creativity, Exploration, Discussion and Learning to help developers learn and get in touch with the industry leaders on these topics.

[Functions 2018][2018] is a **community focused, single track, one day conference** event that moves away from the hype and focuses on the reality serverless based solutions. It's about fostering a community locally and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications.

[Functions 2017][2017] was our inaugural event and we are building on the success of it again this year. We are going to be hosted in a dedicated event space that can accommodate up to 450 attendees in a conveniente and well-known accessible location in downtown Toronto.

## ServerlessDays

We're partnering with ServerlessDays global community to further spread collaboration around this space into the local Toronto community!

ServerlessDays are a family of events around the world focused on fostering a community around serverless technologies. Each ServerlessDay is unique, organised by locals and not run for profit. They are run according the following principles.

- **Local** - Run by local community organisors
- **Accessible** - Financially and physically accessible to the community
- **Representitive** - Be representative of the broader community within which it exists

## Apply to speak

### High Quality Practical Content

Our planning process starts with great quality content, we carefully select topics that our attendees can go right back to work and start adopting. Those topics are laid out [below](#topics) and messaged to our attendees on our website well before announcing speakers, we then find amazing speakers to talk in those spots. This is a lot different than the traditional CFP process.

Don't see a topic you can speak to below? Don't worry submit any way! We read every submission and if you can convince us, we will pursue it further to ensure that it is ready for our primarily startup and enterprise focused attendees.

### Diversity & Inclusion

We want an event that everyone can be proud of. Part of our mission is to support speakers coming from typically underrepresented demographics, so we encourage you to submit and share with your network so we have a large and diverse submission pool to select from. We want to ensure we have an inclusive event, for this reason, **you will be required to legally bind yourself to our code of conduct in our contract process**, and we will investigate you as a speaker to ensure we see the quality and exemplary behaviour.
