# Sponsor Invite

## What is Functions 2018?

[Functions 2018][2018] is a **community focused, single track, one day conference** that moves away from the hype and focuses on the reality of serverless based solutions. It's about fostering a community locally and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications.

[Functions 2017][2017] was our inaugural event and we are building on the success of it again this year. We are going to be hosted in a dedicated event space that can accommodate up to 450 attendees in a convenient and well-known accessible location in downtown Toronto.

## The Conference

- Date: Friday 28 September 2018
- Venue: [TELUS Harbour Conference Space](https://goo.gl/maps/gRj2rvySSTT2)
- Expected attendance: 450

## Format

The conference mixes elements of an unconference and a more traditional conference.

- Breakfast & Networking
- Morning Sessions – Welcome, a keynote and 3 talks
- Lunch – Includes Open Networking
- Afternoon Sessions – 4 sessions + lightning talks
- Closing remarks and happy hour

## Attendee Profile

We expect our attendees to fit into one of two categories:

- Developers who are curious by nature, excited to explore new technologies and ways of doing things. The type of developer we see at serverless events works outside of their comfort zone and is often key to successfully introducing new technologies into an organisation.

- Business stakeholders looking for new solutions to unsolved problems. Technology provides business advantage, we see product managers, programme directors, and CTO's attending looking for something that can help drive their business forward.

At last [year's event][2017] we had attendees from a variety of companies, including startups and enterprise businesses in the North American tech ecosystem. The 2017 event was sold out and we had excellent feedback in the upcoming weeks. Darien Marinez has written up about [his conference experience][darien] and [Here's a 2017 recap post][recap] by our very own Enrico Sacchetti.

## Become a Sponsor

To make the conference happen we need sponsors. The event is relatively no-frills to keep the budget down, but we still have costs to cover. We have a number of sponsorship opportunities.

Using a single-track conference format means we do not have lots of speaker slots. We have decided it would be more beneficial to the conference attendees, organisers and sponsors to use all the slots for amazing, high-quality talks from the serverless community rather than offer these slots as part of the sponsorship package. The Gold Sponsors will have a booth slot in the open space, and will be able to participate in the CFP.
