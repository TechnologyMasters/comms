## What is Functions 2018

FaaS _(Function as a Service)_ architecture is radically changing how software is built and how teams interface with each other and systems at scale. The old paradigms of Web Services and Monolithic APIs are being replaced with remote functions, event-driven architectures, and new standards like Microservices, Serverless and GraphQL. We're organizing a space for Creativity, Exploration, Discussion and Learning to help developers learn and get in touch with the industry leaders on these topics.

## ServerlessDays

We're partnering with ServerlessDays global community to further spread collaboration around this space into the local Toronto community!

ServerlessDays are a family of events around the world focused on fostering a community around serverless technologies.

Each ServerlessDay is unique, organised by locals and not run for profit. They are run according the following principles.

- **Local** - Run by local community organisors
- **Accessible** - Financially and physically accessible to the community
- **Representitive** - Be representative of the broader community within which it exists
